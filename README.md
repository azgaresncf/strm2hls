# strm2hls (V2)

*[as the name says: [some] streaming links to HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)]*

# Why the heck did you created this?
``Well, as too much people says as well, why not!``

Seriously. To have a bit of context, I am a contributor of the [iptv-org/iptv](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv.git) repo, and I have seen so far too much of those "http://free.fullspeed.tv" links. The thing is that this website is currently down by the owner, so we have to fix it, to get as much as streams as we could possibly have.

# How does it work?
First of all, I originally took the user code [pshanmu3](https://github.com/pshanmu3), and then make a new code based on it, so that I could add more and more "services" (e.g. YouTube or Twitch).

# Can I make contribrutions?
Of course you can! Just make sure that your channel isn't inappropriate (NSFW). 

You can do either a simple issue or even a pull request if you feel like it.

# Acknowledgements
I have to thank:
- [pshanmu3](https://github.com/pshanmu3) for inspiring me to do this repo
