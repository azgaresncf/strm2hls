# strm2hls
*[as the name says: [some] streaming links to HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)]*

# why the heck did you created this?
``Well, as too much people says as well, why not!``

Seriously. To have a bit of context, I am a contributor of the [iptv-org/iptv](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv.git) repo, and I have seen so far too much of those "http://free.fullspeed.tv" links. The thing is that this website is currently down by the owner, so we have to fix it, to get as much as streams that we could possibly have.

# how does it work?
Well, I have just honestly took the code from the GitHub user [pshanmu3](https://github.com/pshanmu3), I have made some improvements with his code, and then I will add more and more services (for instance YouTube or Twitch).

# can I make contribrutions?
Of course you can! Just make sure that your channel isn't inappropriate (NSFW). 

You can do either a simple issue or even a pull request if you feel like it.


# note
you can watch all of the converted channels with this link
